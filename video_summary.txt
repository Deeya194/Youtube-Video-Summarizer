 The topic is breath for search and depth for search in this video I'll cover these two traversal methods by taking various examples breath for . search and DEP for search are graph traversal . methods so we'll understand the difference between them through this a small example then afterward I'll take another example .
 In breath for search we will explore a Vertex then we go to the next Vertex for exploration but in depth first search once we started exploring once we visited a new . We will suspend this Vortex and start its exploration so from one we got two then from two we went on three .
 We will learn about breath for Surge and death for sech in detail first of all breath first search . I will take one data structure that is Q I have taken a graph . I'll explain you initial step then I will explain you repeating step .
 The tree that we got here is breath for search spanning tree dotted edges that are called as cross edges . The tree is called as a tree spanning tree . The search was completed and the tree that was completed was completed .
 The rule in bre depth for searches what once you have visited one verticle still one more is remaining leave that we will see it afterwards first you start exploring four so this is the rule . The depth for search for this I will take a stack stack is a data structure used here .
 This is depth for search spanning tree and these edges are called called called as back edges . For this graph we can make a tree like and perform pre-order so this is the pre-ordered of this tree see 1 4 3 10 then 9 then 2 8 756 .
 You can start from any vertices you like and you can visit any neighboring vertices . Once you have visited a new vertice suspend the exploration of current vertices and start exploring new vertices that's all about def first search and breath first search .
